# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

## Introduction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the selling price and status of copper. After cleaning the data, filling missing values, and addressing skewness and outliers, I conducted feature engineering and correlation analysis. I developed a Random Forest regression model for predicting selling prices and an Extra Trees classification model for predicting status. Additionally, I created a Streamlit app that allows users to input data and obtain interactive predictions, displaying the results clearly.

## Overview

## Data Preprocessing

-> Loaded the copper CSV into a DataFrame.      
-> Cleaned and filled missing values, addressed outliers, and adjusted data types.   
-> Analyzed data distribution and treated skewness

## Feature Engineering

-> Assessed feature correlation to identify potential multicollinearity   

## Modeling

-> Built a regression model for selling price prediction.   
-? Built a classification model for status prediction.     
-> Encoded categorical features and optimized hyperparameters.   
-> Pickled the trained models for deployment.

## Streamlit Application

-> Developed a user interface for interacting with the models.   
-> Predicted selling price and status based on user input.
